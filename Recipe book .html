Cut 100 g of chicken fat and cut into cubes with a side of about 1 cm. Chop the carrots into strips 5-6 cm long, about 2 mm wide. Cut the onion into half rings. In the whole garlic, cut off the root part and remove the upper layers of the husk, leaving only the thinnest.Wash the rice in 7-8 waters until the water drained from the rice becomes clear. Fill the rice with warm (37 Â°C) boiled water and add a generous amount of salt, leave for 20-25 minutes. Rice should not protrude above the water, otherwise it will become brittle.
