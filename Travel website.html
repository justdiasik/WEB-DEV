    <ul>
        <li id="main"> Macedonia  </li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Spa_JPG01.jpg/1280px-Spa_JPG01.jpg" width="400" alt="beautiful Macedonia" >
        <p class="des"><em>Macedonia</em> is one of the most unexplored European countries.<br>  There are no crowds of tourists on the streets here, so the local population welcomes every guest.<br> Macedonia is known as one of the world's cultural centers: there are many ancient and medieval monuments on its territory.<br> However, people also come here for the sake of natural beauty: lakes, forests, mountains — all this is in abundance in the country.</p>
        <li id="main"> Mexico </li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Collage_Acapulco.jpg" alt="Mexico" width="400">
        <p class="des"><em>Mexico</em> is a unique cocktail, in which the Spanish, Indian and Caribbean cultures are harmoniously intertwined. The unique local color, the rich history of the warlike people, the stunning natural scenery and the incendiary temperament of the Mexicans attract tourists from all over the world. We will try to understand in detail how this bright country lives, what Mexico and its inhabitants are able to surprise even a seasoned tourist and what you should definitely pay attention to when wandering through the Mexican valleys. You will have an exciting journey to the home of tequila and tortilla, which will leave no doubt that Mexico is a colorful fairy tale with a sharp taste of chili on your lips! </p>
        <li id="main"> Costa-Rica</li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Ciudad_de_San_José.png" alt="Cosra-Rica" width="400">
        <p class="des">The name <em>Costa Rica</em> means "rich coast" in Spanish — which is the name given by Christopher Columbus to a small piece of land that he stumbled upon on September 18, 1502, on his fourth and last trip to the shores of America. He was disappointed — there was no gold here, but the settlers kept the name of the country, and the richness and beauty of the tropical nature made this coast rich in our time.</p>
        <li id="main"> India </li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Navi_Mumbai_Skyline.jpg/1280px-Navi_Mumbai_Skyline.jpg" alt="" width="400">
        <p class="des"><em>India</em> is no place for a coward. Presenting a constant challenge to the mind and body, it thoroughly shakes your entire body. It excites, drains, and enrages. You will soon discover that this is a land where the realities of everyday life prevail over the mysteries of popular myth. Instead of the well-known and often misunderstood mysticism of ancient religions, India can actually offer a very different miracle: the richness of its peoples and landscapes.</p>
        <li id="main"> Madagascar </li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Tsingy_-_099.jpg/1280px-Tsingy_-_099.jpg" alt="" width="400">
        <p class="des"><em>Madagascar</em> is an island off the southeastern coast of Africa. Its entire territory, 587,041 km2, is occupied by the state of the same name with the capital Antananarivo. Why do almost 400,000 tourists flock to such a remote corner of the planet every year? A significant part of them are travelers, for whom it is important to deviate from the well-trodden routes in order to bring a truly unforgettable experience from their vacation. The whole point is that this place allows you to combine a relaxing beach holiday with the opportunity to see stunning landscapes, unique plants and animals. The uniqueness of the natural resources of Madagascar is not exaggerated: a significant part of the representatives of the local flora and fauna you will not find anywhere else in the world.</p>
